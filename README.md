Textel Brand Assets and Guidelines
================================================================================

This repository contains the official brand assets and usage guidelines for
Textel.  Complete guidelines for use are available in the brand_guidelines.pdf
document included in this repository.

## Logo and Wordmark Images
Logo images for use in electronic media are available in the `/img/rgb`
directory.  Image files are provided in SVG, 300 DPI PNG, and 90 DPI PNG
formats.  Images for four-color process printing are available in the
`/img/cmyk` directory.

Wherever possible, the logo should be used over the wordmark.  However, the
wordmark should be used in place of the logo in contexts where the logo is
vertically or horizontally constrained in such a way that the impact of the
logo text is compromised, for example, in a set-height website header with other
textual elements.  In general, in digital contexts, the lettering of the logo
or wordmark must be the largest font-size on the page.

## Fonts and Typography
Textel’s primary font-family is **“Lato”**. The font can be downloaded for Windows 
and OS X for free from [LatoFonts.com](www.latofonts.com).  Web-font definitions 
are available at [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato).  This 
font should be used in all digital and print media for both headings and copy. 
Alternative font weights may be used depending on the context. For digital 
stylesheets, fallback fonts may be specified in the following order: Helvetica 
Neue, Helvetica, Arial,sans-serif.  HTML Email should use Helvetica for 
compatibility reasons.  For applications needing a monospaced font, 
**“Inconsolata”**, available for free 
from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata), should be
used.

## Color Pallet
Please refer to the brand_guidelines.pdf document for brand colors and their
Hex, RGB, and CMYK definitions.

## Sass Variables
A SCSS file containing predefined variables for font families and colors is
available in the `/scss` directory
